Sentiment Analysis Notes
1) Do some research into what I need in order for this to work (API? How will the flow go?)
2) Base planning + framework (functions, flow, etc.)
	- COMMIT THIS
3) Start implementing
	- Test per function, commit everything that works DON'T TRUST YOURSELF :(

Primary Questions
1) How can I get all "positive" or "negative" words? How do I identify words?
	Hypothesis: Feed AI model many reviews and see what it spits out
					   Fix the output according to own specifics if needed
					   Test and continue to train off similar sets

Break up categories into positive negative
	- Later we can do more specific categories for each

Modules (pip install <module-name>)
Pandas = library for data analysis and data manipulation
Matplotlib = library for data visualization
	- specifically need pyplot
Seaborn = library based on matplotlib with high-level interface for data visualization
WordCloud = library to visualize text data
regex = functions to pre-process strings based on given regular expression

NLTK (natural language toolkit for natural language processing) = collection of libraries that deal with natural language processing
	- WordNetLemmatizer = turns sentences into word tokens but retains the context

stopwords = collectyion of words that don't provide much meaning to a sentence (structural words)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Library for Python) (sklearn)

1. CountVectorizer – transform text to vectors

2. GridSearchCV – for hyperparameter tuning

3. RandomForestClassifier – machine learning algorithm for classification

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
